🌼 Hi there! I’m Krithi Hari (she/her)

I’m a sophomore at Drexel University, diving into the fascinating world of Economics and Public Health. I’m truly passionate about exploring how economics, healthcare, and technology intersect to make a meaningful difference in our communities.

🌟 A Bit About Me
I’m an economics enthusiast at heart, always eager to analyze data and trends that can inform better decision-making in public health. My background in AP Microeconomics, AP Macroeconomics, and Calculus has equipped me with the analytical skills I love to apply to real-world projects.

Currently, I'm working on a project aimed at helping elderly individuals manage their medication schedules through a smart app and organizer. I find joy in blending technology with healthcare to create solutions that can truly improve lives.

🎯 Current Focus
I am currently seeking co-op and internship opportunities where I can apply my knowledge, particularly at the intersection of economics and healthcare. I am eager to engage in hands-on experiences that will allow me to make a positive impact in these fields.
